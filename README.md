# IoT Enabled Landmine Detection Robotic Vehicle
Problem Overview
Developing an IoT-enabled robotic vehicle for efficient landmine detection and neutralization in hazardous environments (prototype model), aiming to mitigate the risks and casualties associated with traditional detection methods. Challenges include achieving high detection accuracy while minimizing false positives, ensuring robust mobility over rugged terrains, implementing remote operation and real-time data processing through IoT connectivity, guaranteeing safety for operators and civilians, establishing reliable communication links, and optimizing cost-effectiveness for large-scale deployment. The solution must also adapt to various environmental conditions and incorporate fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidental detonations or malfunctions.

## Existing system
In the existing manual demining process, human deminers often face significant risks while operating in mine-affected areas. These risks include the potential for injury or death from accidental detonations of landmines, as well as exposure to hazardous environmental conditions and psychological stress. EMF coil-based landmine detection systems offer a partial solution by providing a non-contact method for detecting landmines, thereby reducing direct physical contact with potentially explosive devices. However, despite this advantage, manual deminers using EMF coil-based systems still face risks associated with working in hazardous environments, such as uneven terrain, extreme weather conditions, and the presence of other explosive remnants of war. Furthermore, the effectiveness of EMF coil-based systems in detecting landmines can vary depending on factors such as soil composition, moisture levels, and the presence of metallic clutter, which may require deminers to spend extended periods in the field conducting thorough surveys. Overall, while EMF coil-based systems contribute to mitigating some of the risks associated with manual demining operations, they do not eliminate the need for human intervention entirely. Therefore, there remains a critical need for the development of advanced robotic solutions that can autonomously detect and neutralize landmines, reducing the reliance on manual deminers and minimizing human risk in mine-affected areas.
